# Analog-to-Digital-Data-Acquisition-Card
this project has two main parts:
1. ADC board
2. GUI
### ADC Board
This is an Analog to Digital Data acquisition card based on ATxmega64A3U microcontroller. Low power, high performance 8/16-bit AVR microcontroller featuring 64KB self-programming flash program memory, 4KB boot code section, 4KB SRAM, 2048-Byte EEPROM, 4-channel DMA controller, 8-channel event system, and up to 32 MIPS throughput at 32MHz. The ATxmega A3 series features 64-pin packages. it has 8 ADC with 12-bit, 2msps Analog to Digital Converters. the code of this project is developed with atmel studio 6.2. 
you can see the PCB which is designed for this board in this picture:

 as we can see in the PCB it has a USB connection which is one of the peripherals of our microcontroller. it is a USB2 full speed (12Mbps). I was interested in an adjustable ADC channel for this board which can be selected by the user. In this regard, I needed a Digital potentiometers(MCP41010). you can see the schematic that is designed with this adjustable potentiometer. Single/Dual Digital Potentiometer with SPIâ„¢ Interface

 ## GUI software
 The GUI part is developed based on labview software while user can control and monitor everything from this GUI. you can see this GUI in the following figure

all the data can be stored on the pc with this GUI.
