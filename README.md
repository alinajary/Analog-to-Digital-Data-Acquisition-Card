# Analog-to-Digital-Data-Acquisition-Card
this project has two main parts:
1. ADC board
2. GUI
### ADC Board
This is an Analog to Digital Data acquisition card based on ATxmega64A3U microcontroller. Low power, high performance 8/16-bit AVR microcontroller featuring 64KB self-programming flash program memory, 4KB boot code section, 4KB SRAM, 2048-Byte EEPROM, 4-channel DMA controller, 8-channel event system, and up to 32 MIPS throughput at 32MHz. The ATxmega A3 series features 64-pin packages. it has 8 ADC with 12-bit, 2msps Analog to Digital Converters. the code of this project is developed with atmel studio 6.2.
